# Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is a decentralized uncensorable peer-to-peer electronic cash system as outlined in the [Bitcoin whitepaper](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto that has fast, secure, reliable, and low fee transactions running on a permissionless blockchain network. Bitcoin Cash is the upgraded version of Bitcoin which carries the same genesis block that was started with Bitcoin in January 2009. You can learn more about it by reading *[What is Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.substack.com/p/what-is-bitcoin-cash-bch)*.

# Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is Decentralized

BCH doesn't have a single official Github repository. Due to it's decentralized blockchain and p2p network, there are several Bitcoin Cash software client implementations, listed below in no specific order.

# Bitcoin Cash Mining

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is the same mining algorithm used by Bitcoin (BTC), as both coins share the same blockchain genesis. Miners can easily switch between the two coins, and miners are distributed all over the world. Miners can leave and rejoin the network at will. Below is a [snapshot](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek) of the last 7 days of mining BCH blocks as provided by Coin.Dance.
